 this is most important component in this app
 

 this is how default props are assigned \
   static defaultProps = {
    country: "in",
    pageSize: 8,
    category: "general",
  };


  and this how proptypes are assigned

   static propTypes = {
    country: PropTypes.string,
    pageSize: PropTypes.number,
    category: PropTypes.string,
    named: PropTypes.string,
    apikey:PropTypes.string
  };

NOTE THAT STATES ARE DIFFERNET AND PROPS ARE DIFFERNET
states pass value to paremt component
and props are send by parent component

in this news app state is passed as props
example

this.props.setProgress(20);



here infinite scroll  also used

    <InfiniteScroll
          dataLength={this.state.articles.length}
          next={this.fetchMoreData}
          hasMore={this.state.articles.length !== this.state.totalResults}
          loader={<Spinner/>}


        >


        infinite scroll and api integretion is most crucial part of this app
